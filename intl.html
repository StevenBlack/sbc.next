		<h3>Steven Black's INTL Toolkit is Hassle Free</h3>
		<p>INTL is a snap to integrate into new and existing applications. Simply do the following things:</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span6">

		<ul>
			<li>Create an INTL object early in the application's startup/</li>

			<li>Add a line to your baseform <code>INIT()</code> to message INTL</li>

			<li>Make GENMENUX your menu generator</li>

			<li>Build your application</li>

			<li>Voila, you are basically done and ready to give a very credible demo to your boss or
			customer!&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="span6">
		<p>Other things that come up include finish and polish issues like:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Some VFP services come from VFP, others from Windows, so you may need localized versions of these
			in your final installations. See <a href="SBCPublicDomain.html">Downloads</a> for GOTCHAS, a
			utillity that audits your project for instances of the known issues. These issues are also listed in my
			<a href="/intl-vfp/">VFP International Issues page</a> to get an idea of some of the no-nos you may
			have coded in your application. GOTCHAS will find all these for you.</li>

			<li>Expunge hard-coded messages from your applcation. See&nbsp; <a
			href="SBCPublicDomain.html">Downloads</a> for a public-domain version of MsgSvc to see how that
			works.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>INTL retrofits easily into new and existing apps.</h3>

		<p>INTL is a great component. It is both a complete back box you can use immediately, and also a highly
		hooked and extendible component that you can tailor, extend, or subclass as you need.</p>

		<p>INTL is a great component because:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>it comes will full annotated source code.</li>

			<li>it is tuned for each version of VFP for maximum performance.</li>

			<li>it has great documentation.</li>

			<li>its classes are explicitly named for the design patterns it used so functionality is easily
			unerstood.</li>

			<li>it provides hooks for every action so you can easily change default behavior.</li>

			<li>it provides a number of specialized localization strategies that you can add-on for particular
			locales. For example, you would use the right-to-Left strategy to localize for the Middle-East and the
			Orient, or add-in the multi-currency strategy on forms displaying financial data.</li>

			<li>you can loalize strings, fonts, images, data sources, as required, with easy to configure add-in
			strategies for each.</li>

		<h3>INTL is high-quality source code</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>"...the source code itself is a treasure. I get to see a
			lot of source, and Steven's is among the best I've seen."</p>

	    <p>Steven Black's INTL Toolkit is a great example of literate programming. It is designed
	    in such a way as to teach you the maximum about itself, and also about FoxPro.</p>

	    <p>Much of INTL's architecture is named explicitly after the design patterns it emulates.
	    The result is a black box tool that'll easily become a white box in the unlikely event you need to change
	    it to your particular circumstances.</p>
