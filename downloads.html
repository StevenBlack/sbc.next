For example, the <strong>DEFINE PAD</strong> menu command has <strong>PROMPT</strong>, <strong>FONT</strong>, <strong>KEY</strong>,and <strong>MESSAGE</strong> clauses, all of 
		which tend to be hard-coded. <strong>Gotchas</strong> will report the exact locations of all occurrences of <strong>DEFINE PAD</strong>, and dozens of other commands and functions.
