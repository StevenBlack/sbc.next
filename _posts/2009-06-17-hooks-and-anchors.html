<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>
This document describes an object-oriented design pattern
called Hooks and Anchors. Consider this a discussion document.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Hooks and anchors</strong> is an object society that I
first designed and implemented in 1996 and used ever since.
It has served me well in numerous desktop and internet applications.
</p>

<p>
Here's how this paper goes: first we start by examining the class structure of <strong>Hooks</strong> and hook
subclasses.
</p>

<p>
Next we'll discuss the <strong>Anchor</strong> class.
Anchors, as with real boat anchors, are a type of Hook.
</p>

<p>
This is a cool conceptual nuance -- why would an Anchor be a subclass of
Hook? The placement of hooks and anchors under a common hook superclass, is explained.
</p>

<p>
Next we'll look at how particular design patterns are conducive to
implementations involving with hooks and anchors.
</p>


<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Most good object-oriented frameworks can be described as skeletal
structures designed for extension.
Developers evolve their base framework(s), refining and extending them over time.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, all the root frameworks give you so-called hot spots,
known as Hook Methods or, as Gamma and Helm call them, Template Methods.
To varying degrees, the framework(s) you use also supply a
philosophy about usage and extension. Typically the suggested philosophy
is: you hook the framework's hook methods to suit your implementation-specific
needs.
</p>

<p>In the Hooks and Anchors design pattern, the hook is implemented with
a hook object society, which is designed at the outset to fully
encapsulate work of the hook method. The hook method, therefore,
reduces to a <a href="/articles/hook-operations/">hook operation</a> that delegates program flow to the society
of hook objects.</p>

<p>In other words, at the program's critical junctures, instead of adding code
to specifically
named hook methods, Hook and Anchor pattern implementations use a hook class instead,
which hides a society of hooks and anchors, placing code in a polymorphically-named
action methods of fine grained hook classes.</p>

<p> In the Hooks and Anchors design presented here, the hook class provides a <code>::Process()</code>
method that is called by clients. The <code>::Process()</code> method handles pre- and
post-processing, calling a protected method named ::Execute() method wherein
the hook's real deed is done.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore</strong>, A Hooks and Anchors society is the sort of thing you call from a hot spot, usually instead of most or all the code you
would normally place there.</p>

<p>The crux of the matter is this: since we're talking about VFP here, the Hooks and Anchors
society is, <em>of course</em>, natively engineered to be metadata-driven in both
composition and execution.</p>


<h2>Class Structure</h2>


<p>This section focuses on the morphology of the Hooks and
Anchors solution framework. We develop the concept of hook chains and anchors,
and how they can be simply combined in the same class hierarchy.</p>

<h3>UML Development</h3>

<p>Using UML notation, Figure 1 illustrates an atomic concept
of object-oriented software: two separate classes with a one-way, 1:1
relationship between them. In this
case, SomeClass holds a reference to SomeHook through the SomeClass.oHook member property </p>

<p class="clearboth"><img width=227 height=57 src="/images/clip_image004.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><strong><em>Figure 1.</em></strong><em> a fundamental object micro
society.</em></p>

<p>Figure 2 shows a variation of the relationship in Figure
1, except now assume that two collaborating classes are descendents of a common
Parent Class. This assumption may seem
like a stretch. If the classes descend
from a common parent, then the semantics of the relationship can easily be
refactored and generalized into the parent class. If on the other hand the classes do not descend from a common
parent, then we can get the same effect with code duplication. For now, lets agree to keep things simple,
and descend from a common parent, if only for convenience.</p>

<p class="clearboth"><img width=208 height=155 src="/images/clip_image006.gif" alt=""> </p>

<p><strong><em>Figure 2.</em></strong><em> First-pass generalization of
the object micro society to a common ancestor.</em></p>

<p>Into the Parent Class of Figure 2 we can now refactor
upwards, moving the details of the relationship into the parent class, which
leads to the hierarchy illustrated in Figure 3. Its not obvious upon first glance, but the hierarchy in Figure 3
excels at providing components for object chains, like for example the one
illustrated in Figure 4. The key to this is the self-referential relationship
link on the Hook Parent Class as illustrated in Figure 3.</p>

<p class="clearboth"><img width=420 height=168 src="/images/clip_image008.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><em><strong>Figure 3.</strong> At left, all the descendants of the Hook Parent Class inherit the
self-referential relationship, and this makes them easily assembled together
into chains. The diagram thus reduces abstractly to the one on the right,
representing a single class with self-referential semantics.</em></p>

<p>In my experience great things can happen when you sensibly
use self-referential structures like those of Figure 3 to create solutions that
execute objects sequentially, as illustrated in the class diagram in Figure 4,
and also illustrated in the corresponding stair-shaped sequence diagram
illustrated in Figure 5.</p>

<p class="clearboth"><img width=276 height=57 src="/images/clip_image010.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><em><strong>Figure 4.</strong> A
chain of N objects linked together. Normally control passes from instances of Hook1 to Hook2 to Hook3, and
so on, normally without any intervention from a controlling object.</em></p>

<h2>Implementation Qualities of Hook Chains</h2>

<p>In this section we discuss the types of implementations
that naturally lend themselves to solutions by hook chains, then well list
some of the Gamma and Helm design patterns that can be created with hook
chains, and finally well as list and explain some of the problems Ive
encountered when implementing hook chains.</p>

<h3>Applications of Hook Chains</h3>

<p>According to Riel [2]. the stair shaped interaction of
hook chains, as illustrated in Figure 5, is expected to be appropriate in the
following situations.</p>


<ul>
	<li>
		When operations have a strong connection
		<ul>
			<li>Consists-of hierarchy: country-state-city</li>
			<li>Info hierarchy: document-section-topic</li>
			<li>Temporal: ad-order-invoice-deliver</li>
			<li>Conceptual: person-customer-key account</li>
			<li>Operations always in the same order</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Decentralized programming is possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Abstraction of Hook Chains into Fundamental Design Patterns</h3>

<p>When we analyze an object chain of two or more objects, we
see that it can be applied in several of the most common structural and
behavioral Gamma and Helm Design Patterns, some of which are listed in Table 1.</p>

structures&quot; abstractions.</em></p>

<h3>Some Notable Problems with Hook Chains</h3>

<p>Given the usefulness of chained structures for creating a
variety of micro- architectures, here is are some of the problems that come
with using chains. These problems typically get worse as the chain gets longer
and/or more diverse:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Creating and initializing the chain</strong>  Hook
chains can be short or long, and regardless they need to be assembled,
sequenced, and configured. This can be
done with some sort of abstract factory, and be aided if the hooks know how to
chain themselves together. Then
consider the desirability of creating chains from metadata. Therefore the
process of creating chains needs abstracting.</p>

<li><p><strong>Chain execution control (pre-empting, escaping,
re-entering)</strong>  looking at Figure 5, its hard to imagine invoking an
automatic sequential chain of activity without all the control required to
properly handle errors and other execution issues like escaping and re-entering
the chain.</p>

<li><p><strong>Coupling between chain elements</strong>  Coupling comes
in many forms, like control coupling (when execution order is important),
content coupling (when one object messes directly with the internals of
another), data coupling (when specific data needs to be shared between
objects), external coupling (when an object depends on other external objects),
stamp coupling (when two components modify or access data in the same
object). All these coupling hinder to
some degree the integrity, flexibility, and reusability of the chain and its elements.</p>

<li><p><strong>Selective iteration of the chain</strong>  The
assumption that every object will fire does not always hold. How then to execute a particular sequence of
objects if they are physically chained in another sequence?</p>

<li><p><strong>Returning multiple values</strong>  How do you return
multiple values, or aggregate the return values, from a single chain of
execution that may be composed of several distinct operations.</p>

<li><p><strong>Error and notification handling</strong>  How to handle
errors and notifications in a hook chain?</p>
</ul>

<h2>Extending and Enhancing Hook Chains with Hook Anchors</h2>

<p>In the previous section we show that hook chains have both
good and not-so-good qualities. Can
some of the not-so-good qualities be mitigated?</p>

<p>The complement of the stair-shaped interaction diagram
of Figure 5 is the fork-shaped interaction pattern, illustrated in Figure
6. This illustrates a prototypical
so-called god-object situation, where behavior is centralized in a single
object that manipulates the other objects.</p>

<p class="clearboth"><img width=137 height=127 src="/images/clip_image024.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><em><strong>Figure 6.</strong> When an object has direct control over other objects, the sequence
diagram of the interaction exhibits a fork-shaped interaction pattern.</em></p>

<p>Here are some of the situations that call for a
god-objects fork interaction patterns:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>When operations can change order</p>
	<li><p>When new operations could be inserted</p>
	<li><p>When centralized control is necessary and unavoidable</p>
</ul>

<p>Note as well that holding many concurrent references to
external objects pretty much comes with being a god-object. </p>

<p>Lets extend the class hierarchy of Figure 3 and enhance
it with a new class for coordination and control purposes. In Figure 7, this new god-object class is
the Hook Anchor class, which could possesses, among other things:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>A .aHook member array (or if in VFP 8, a reference to
	collection) to hold zero or more objects of any subclass of Hook Parent Class. Thus a chain of objects can be built in
	two different ways: as a simple chain of independent objects, or aggregately
	referenced by an instance of Hook Anchor which will iteratively invoke them. </p>

	<li><p>A LOAD() method, called upon INIT(), which takes care of creating and assembling objects, or chains of objects.</p>

	<li><p>The ability to iterate through a list of objects and,
	between each, test whether to stop the hook iteration.</p>
</ul>

<p class="clearboth"><img width=496 height=268 src="/images/clip_image026.gif" alt="" ></p>

<p><em><strong>Figure 7.</strong> Extending the class hierarchy, this time introducing Anchors, which are
designed to address the problems of free-form hook chains by providing the
ability to concurrently hold many hook objects as well as iterate them in
custom and controlled ways.</em></p>

<p>A notable concept to grasp from Figure 7 is that Anchor
classes are hooks. Since hooks can
reference hooks, and hooks can be chained, all this applies to Anchors as well.</p>

<h3>Abstraction of Hook Anchors into Fundamental Design Patterns</h3>

design patterns  especially the creational ones  that the Hook Anchor classes

<h2>Upsides</h2>

<p>Here are some advantages of Hooks and Anchors</p>
<ul>
	<li>Runtime configurable.
	<li>Process clones and variants are easily created.
	<li>Modular design, construction, and implementation.
</ul>
<h2>Downsides</h2>

<p>Here are some downsides with Hooks and Anchors as
presented here.</p>

<p>It takes some getting used to, and its not easy to
abstract all the operations of a process into logical independent hooks, and to
thereafter anchor them and iterate them properly.</p>

<p>Its more complex than simple subclassing and filling
hot-spot methods.</p>

<p>Plugging in a new object involves steps that are
vulnerable to configuration mistakes without tool support. Using BROWSE on a VFP configuration table is
only good for those who already know what they are doing.</p>

<h2>Applications  Putting it all together</h2>


<p>This section serves as an outline of what will be discussed
in the session, and quite probably be included with sample programs on the
conference CD, or downloadable from my website at http://stevenblack.com.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> <a href="HooksAndAnchorsDesignPattern_CleaningUpHTML.html">Parsers -- Cleaning up HTML</a>
  (sample with code)

<li>Processes -- A Shopping Cart

<li>Localization  INTL
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This paper briefly describes the major elements of the
Hooks and Anchors solution framework. Approaching problems this in this way isnt for everyone, nor is
suitable for all situations. For real hot spots, where your application can be
expect evolution stress, it can be just the ticket.</p>

<h3>Hooks and Anchors Design Pattern, Example 1</h3>

<p><strong>MS Excel "Save As HTML" cleanup.</strong></p>

<p>Given you've got <strong>Odious Crap HTML From MS Excel</strong> like
<a href="/files/CrapFromExcel.HTM" target="_blank"><em>this</em></a> (view its source), how to
cleanse it so it's <strong>generic and clean</strong> like, say, <a href="/files/CleanHTMLFromExcel.HTM" target="_blank">this</a> (view source)?? </p>
<p>Simple. You set up an object society like the one illustrated below, whose life and execution is controlled by HooksConfig.DBF records, listed in the table below the diagram.</p>
<p>Complete source code here: <a href="/files/HooksAndAnchors.ZIP">HooksAndAnchors.ZIP</a></p>
